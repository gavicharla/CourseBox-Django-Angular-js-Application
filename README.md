# CourseBox-Django-Angular-js-Application
This is my first django application which will provide the platform between students and teachers
In this application teachers can create the courses and run them and students can enroll to those courses and do those courses
I have developed this application in just four days i.e., I have worked around 13 hours a day continously to complete this project

Do visit the project at
